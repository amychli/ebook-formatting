<p class="nonindent">Cereal is the name given to those seeds used as food (wheat, rye, oats,
    barley, corn, rice, etc.), which are produced by plants belonging to the
    vast order known as the grass family. They are used for food both in the
    unground state and in various forms of mill products.</p>

<p>The grains are pre-eminently nutritious, and when well prepared, easily
    digested foods. In composition they are all similar, but variations in
    their constituent elements and the relative amounts of these various
    elements, give them different degrees of alimentary value. They each
    contain one or more of the nitrogenous elements,--gluten, albumen,
    caseine, and fibrin,--together with starch, dextrine, sugar, and fatty
    matter, and also mineral elements and woody matter, or cellulose. The
    combined nutritive value of the grain foods is nearly three times that
    of beef, mutton, or poultry. As regards the proportion of the food
    elements necessary to meet the various requirements of the system,
    grains approach more nearly the proper standard than most other foods;
    indeed, wheat contains exactly the correct proportion of the food
    elements.</p>

<p>Being thus in themselves so nearly perfect foods, and when properly
    prepared, exceedingly palatable and easy of digestion, it is a matter of
    surprise that they are not more generally used; yet scarcely one family
    in fifty makes any use of the grains, save in the form of flour, or an
    occasional dish of rice or oatmeal. This use of grains is far too meager
    to adequately represent their value as an article of diet. Variety in
    the use of grains is as necessary as in the use of other food material,
    and the numerous grain preparations now to be found in market render it
    quite possible to make this class of foods a staple article of diet, if
    so desired, without their becoming at all monotonous.</p>

<p>In olden times the grains were largely depended upon as a staple food,
    and it is a fact well authenticated by history that the highest
    condition of man has always been associated with wheat-consuming
    nations. The ancient Spartans, whose powers of endurance are proverbial,
    were fed on a grain diet, and the Roman soldiers who under Caesar
    conquered the world, carried each a bag of parched grain in his pocket
    as his daily ration.</p>

<p>Other nationalities at the present time make extensive use of the
    various grains. Rice used in connection with some of the leguminous
    seeds, forms the staple article of diet for a large proportion of the
    human race. Rice, unlike the other grain foods, is deficient in the
    nitrogenous elements, and for this reason its use needs to be
    supplemented by other articles containing an excess of the nitrogenous
    material. It is for this reason, doubtless, that the Hindoos use
    lentils, and the Chinese eat peas and beans in connection with rice.</p>

<p>We frequently meet people who say they cannot use the grains,--that they
    do not agree with them. With all deference to the opinion of such
    people, it may be stated that the difficulty often lies in the fact that
    the grain was either not properly cooked, not properly eaten, or not
    properly accompanied. A grain, simply because it is a grain, is by no
    means warranted to faithfully fulfil its mission unless properly
    treated. Like many another good thing excellent in itself, if found in
    bad company, it is prone to create mischief, and in many cases the root
    of the whole difficulty may be found in the excessive amount of sugar
    used with the grain.</p>

<p>Sugar is not needed with grains to increase their alimentary value. The
    starch which constitutes a large proportion of their food elements must
    itself be converted into sugar by the digestive processes before
    assimilation, hence the addition of cane sugar only increases the burden
    of the digestive organs, for the pleasure of the palate. The Asiatics,
    who subsist largely upon rice, use no sugar upon it, and why should it
    be considered requisite for the enjoyment of wheat, rye, oatmeal,
    barley, and other grains, any more than it is for our enjoyment of bread
    or other articles made from these same grains? Undoubtedly the use of
    grains would become more universal if they were served with less or no
    sugar. The continued use of sugar upon grains has a tendency to cloy the
    appetite, just as the constant use of cake or sweetened bread in the
    place of ordinary bread would do. Plenty of nice, sweet cream or fruit
    juice, is a sufficient dressing, and there are few persons who after a
    short trial would not come to enjoy the grains without sugar, and would
    then as soon think of dispensing with a meal altogether as to dispense
    with the grains.</p>

<p>Even when served without sugar, the grains may not prove altogether
    healthful unless they are properly eaten. Because they are made soft by
    the process of cooking and on this account do not require masticating to
    break them up, the first process of digestion or insalivation is usually
    overlooked. But it must be remembered that grains are largely composed
    of starch, and that starch must be mixed with the saliva, or it will
    remain undigested in the stomach, since the gastric juice only digests
    the nitrogenous elements. For this reason it is desirable to eat the
    grains in connection with some hard food. Whole-wheat wafers, nicely
    toasted to make them crisp and tender, toasted rolls, and unfermented
    zwieback, are excellent for this purpose. Break two or three wafers into
    rather small pieces over each individual dish before pouring on the
    cream. In this way, a morsel of the hard food may be taken with each
    spoonful of the grains. The combination of foods thus secured, is most
    pleasing. This is a specially advantageous method of serving grains for
    children, who are so liable to swallow their food without proper
    mastication.</p>

<h2>Cooking of Grains</h2>

<p class="nonindent">All grains, with the exception of rice, and the
    various grain meals, require prolonged cooking with gentle and
    continuous heat, in order to so disintegrate their tissues and change
    their starch into dextrine as to render them easy of digestion. Even the
    so-called "steam-cooked" grains, advertised to be ready for use in five
    or ten minutes, require a much longer cooking to properly fit them for
    digestion. These so-called quickly prepared grains are simply steamed
    before grinding, which has the effect to destroy any low organisms
    contained in the grain. They are then crushed and shredded. Bicarbonate
    of soda and lime is added to help dissolve the albuminoids, and
    sometimes diastase to aid the conversion of the starch into sugar; but
    there is nothing in this preparatory process that so alters the chemical
    nature of the grain as to make it possible to cook it ready for easy
    digestion in five or ten minutes. An insufficiently cooked grain,
    although it may be palatable, is not in a condition to be readily acted
    upon by the digestive fluids, and is in consequence left undigested to
    act as a mechanical irritant.</p>

<p>For the proper cooking of grains the double boiler is the best and most
    convenient utensil for ordinary purposes. If one does not possess a
    double boiler, a very fair substitute may be improvised by using a
    covered earthen crock placed within a kettle of boiling water, or by
    using two pails, a smaller within a larger one containing boiling water.</p>

<p>A closed steamer or steam-cooker is also valuable for the cooking of
    grains. Grains may be cooked in an ordinary kettle, but the difficulties
    to be encountered, in order to prolong the cooking sufficiently and
    prevent burning, make it the least desirable utensil for this purpose.</p>

<p>Water is the liquid usually employed for cooking grains, but many of
    them are richer and finer flavored when milk is mixed with the
    water,--one part to two of water. Especially is this true of rice,
    hominy, and farina. When water is used, soft water is preferable to
    hard. No salt is necessary, but if used at all, it is generally added to
    the water before stirring in the grain or meal.</p>

<p>The quantity of liquid required varies with the different grains, the
    manner in which they are milled, the method by which they are cooked,
    and the consistency desired for the cooked grain, more liquid being
    required for a porridge than for a mush. The following table gives the
    time necessary for cooking and the quantity of liquid required for the
    various grains, with the exception of rice, when cooked in a double
    boiler or closed steamer, to produce a mush of ordinary consistency. If
    an ordinary kettle is used for cooking the grains, a larger quantity of
    water will be needed:</p>

<p>All grains should be carefully looked over before being put to cook.</p>

<p>In the cooking of grains, the following points should be observed:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Measure both liquid and grain accurately with the same utensil, or
        with two of equal size.</li>
    <li>Have the water boiling when the grain is introduced, but do not
        allow it to boil for a long time previous, until it is considerably
        evaporated, as that will change the proportion of water and grain
        sufficiently to alter the consistency of the mush when cooked. Introduce
        the grain slowly, so as not to stop the sinking to the bottom, and the
        whole becomes thickened. If the grain is cooked in a double boiler, this
        first boiling should be done with the inner dish directly over the fire,
        and when the grain has thickened or become "set," as it is termed, the
        dish should at once be placed in the outer boiler, the water in which
        should be boiling. It will then require no further care during the
        entire cooking, safe to keep the outer boiler filled and the water
        boiling. If the grain is to be cooked in a steam-cooker, as soon as set
        it may be turned into a china or an earthen dish, suitable for use on
        the table, and placed at once in the steamer to complete the cooking. If
        an ordinary kettle is used, it is well to place it upon an iron ring or
        brick on some part of the range were it will just simmer, for the
        remainder of the cooking.</li>
    <li>Stir the grain continuously until it has set, but not at all
        afterward. Grains are much more appetizing if, while properly softened,
        they can still be made to retain their original form. Stirring renders
        the preparation pasty, and destroys its appearance. Grains cooked in a
        double boiler will require no stirring, and there will be little danger
        of their being lumpy, underdone on top, and scorched at the bottom, as
        is so often the case when cooked in a single boiler.</li>
    <li>Cook continuously. If it be necessary to replenish the water in the
        outer boiler at anytime, let it be done with water of boiling
        temperature. If it is desired to have the mush quite thick and dry, the
        boiler should be left uncovered during the latter part of the cooking.
        If preferred moist, keep the cover on.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the preparation of all mushes with meal or flour, it is a good plan
    to make the material into a batter with a portion of the liquid retained
    from the quantity given, before introducing it into the boiling water.
    This prevents the tendency to cook in lumps, so frequent when dry meal
    is scattered into boiling liquid. Care must be taken, however, to add
    the moistened portion very slowly, stirring vigorously meantime, so that
    the boiling will not be checked. Use warm water for moistening. The
    other directions given for the whole or broken grains are applicable to
    the ground products.</p>

<h2>Grains for Breakfast</h2>

<p class="nonindent">Since hasty preparation will not suffice for
    the grains, they cannot be conveniently cooked in the morning in time
    for breakfast. This difficulty may be obviated by cooking the day
    previous, and reheating in the following way:</p>

<p>Place the grain, when sufficiently cooked, in the refrigerator or in
    some place where it will cool quickly (as slow cooling might cause
    fermentation), to remain overnight. If cooked in a porcelain-lined or
    granite-ware double boiler, it may be left undisturbed, if uncovered. If
    cooked in tin or iron, turn the grain into a large earthen or china
    dish. To heat in the morning, fill the outer boiler with boiling water,
    place the inner dish containing the grain therein, and steam until
    thoroughly heated. No stirring and no additional liquid will be
    necessary, and if placed upon the stove when beginning the preparations
    for breakfast, it will be ready for serving in good season. If the grain
    has been kept in an earthen dish, it may best be reheated by placing
    that inside the steam cooker or an ordinary steamer over a kettle of
    boiling water.</p>

<p>Cracked wheat, pearl wheat, oatmeal, and other course grain preparations
    to be reheated, require for cooking a half cup of water in addition to
    the quantity given in the table. For rolled wheat, rolled oats, rolled
    rye, and other crushed grains, no more is needed. Grains may be used for
    breakfast without reheating, if served with hot milk or cream. If one
    has an Aladdin oven, the problem of grains for breakfast may be easily
    solved by cooking them all night, and if started late in the evening,
    they may be thus cooked over a single burner oil stove with the flame
    turned low.</p>

<h2>Grains an Economical Food</h2>

<p class="nonindent">While grains are pre-eminently among
    the most nutritious of foods, they are also among the most economical,
    the average price being from five to seven cents a pound, and even less
    when purchased in bulk. If it be objected that they require much fuel to
    secure the prolonged cooking necessary, we would say that a few cents'
    worth of oil a week and a small lamp stove will accomplish the cooking
    in a most efficient manner. For a hot-weather food there are few
    articles which give greater satisfaction and require less time and labor
    on the part of the housewife than grains, cooked by the aid of a small
    lamp stove.</p>
