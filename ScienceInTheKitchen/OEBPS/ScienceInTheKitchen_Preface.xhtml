<p class="nonindent">The interest in scientific cookery, particularly in cookery as related
    to health, has manifestly increased in this country within the last
    decade as is evidenced by the success which has attended every
    intelligent effort for the establishment of schools for instruction in
    cookery in various parts of the United States. While those in charge of
    these schools have presented to their pupils excellent opportunities for
    the acquirement of dexterity in the preparation of toothsome and
    tempting viands, but little attention has been paid to the science of
    dietetics, or what might be termed the hygiene of cookery.</p>

<p>A little less than ten years ago the Sanitarium at Battle Creek Mich.,
    established an experimental kitchen and a school of cookery under the
    supervision of Mrs. Dr. Kellogg, since which time, researches in the
    various lines of cookery and dietetics have been in constant progress in
    the experimental kitchen, and regular sessions of the school of cookery
    have been held. The school has gradually gained in popularity, and the
    demand for instruction has become so great that classes are in session
    during almost the entire year.</p>

<p>During this time, Mrs. Kellogg has had constant oversight of the cuisine
    of both the Sanitarium and the Sanitarium Hospital, preparing bills of
    fare for the general and diet tables, and supplying constantly new
    methods and original recipes to meet the changing and growing demands of
    an institution numbering always from 500 to 700 inmates.</p>

<p>These large opportunities for observation, research, and experience,
    have gradually developed a system of cookery, the leading features of
    which are so entirely novel and so much in advance of the methods
    heretofore in use, that it may be justly styled, <i>A New System of
    Cookery</i>. It is a singular and lamentable fact, the evil consequences of
    which are wide-spread, that the preparation of food, although involving
    both chemical and physical processes, has been less advanced by the
    results of modern researches and discoveries in chemistry and physics,
    than any other department of human industry. Iron mining, glass-making,
    even the homely art of brick-making, and many of the operations of the
    farm and the dairy, have been advantageously modified by the results of
    the fruitful labors of modern scientific investigators. But the art of
    cookery is at least a century behind in the march of scientific
    progress. The mistress of the kitchen is still groping her way amid the
    uncertainties of mediæval methods, and daily bemoaning the sad results
    of the "rule of thumb." The chemistry of cookery is as little known to
    the average housewife as were the results of modern chemistry to the old
    alchemists; and the attempt to make wholesome, palatable, and
    nourishing food by the methods commonly employed, is rarely more
    successful than that of those misguided alchemists in transmuting lead
    and copper into silver and gold.</p>

<p>These large opportunities for observation, research, and experience,
    have gradually developed a system of cookery, the leading features of
    which are so entirely novel and so much in advance of the methods

    of the "rule of thumb." The chemistry of cookery is as little known to
    the average housewife as were the results of modern chemistry to the old
    alchemists; and the attempt to make wholesome, palatable, and
    nourishing food by the methods commonly employed, is rarely more
    successful than that of those misguided alchemists in transmuting lead
    and copper into silver and gold.</p>

<p>The new cookery brings order from out the confusion of mixtures and
    messes, often incongruence and incompatible, which surrounds the average
    cook, by the elucidation of the principles which govern the operations
    of the kitchen, with the same certainty with which the law of gravity
    rules the planets.</p>
    
<p>Those who have made themselves familiar with Mrs. Kellogg's system of
    cookery, invariably express themselves as trebly astonished: first, at
    the simplicity of the methods employed; secondly, at the marvelous
    results both as regards palatableness, wholesomeness, and
    attractiveness; thirdly, that it had never occurred to them "to do this
    way before."</p>
    
<p>This system does not consist simply of a rehash of what is found in
    every cook book, but of new methods, which are the result of the
    application of the scientific principles of chemistry and physics to the
    preparation of food in such a manner as to make it the most nourishing,
    the most digestible, and the most inviting to the eye and to the palate.</p>
    
<p>Those who have tested the results of Mrs. Kellogg's system of cookery at
    the Sanitarium tables, or in their own homes through the instruction of
    her pupils, have been most enthusiastic in their expressions of
    satisfaction and commendation. Hundreds of original recipes which have
    appeared in her department in <i>Good Health</i>, "Science in the Household",
    have been copied into other journals, and are also quite largely
    represented in the pages of several cook books which have appeared
    within the last few years.</p>
    
<p>The great success which attended the cooking school in connection with
    the Bay View Assembly (the Michigan Chautauqua), as well as the uniform
    success which has met the efforts of many of the graduates of the
    Sanitarium school of cookery who have undertaken to introduce the new
    system through the means of cooking classes in various parts of the
    United States, has created a demand for a fuller knowledge of the
    system.</p>
    
<p>This volume is the outgrowth of the practical and experimental work, and
    the popular demand above referred to. Its preparation has occupied the
    entire leisure time of the author during the last five or six years. No
    pains or expense has been spared to render the work authoritative on all
    questions upon which it treats, and in presenting it to the public, the
    publishers feel the utmost confidence that the work will meet the
    highest expectations of those who have waited impatiently for its
    appearance during the months which have elapsed since its preparation
    was first announced.</p>
