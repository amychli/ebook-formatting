<h1>Cookery</h1>

<p class="nonindent">It is not enough that good and proper food material be provided; it must
    have such preparation as will increase and not diminish its alimentary
    value. The unwholesomeness of food is quite as often due to bad cookery
    as to improper selection of material. Proper cookery renders good food
    material more digestible. When scientifically done, cooking changes each
    of the food elements, with the exception of fats, in much the same
    manner as do the digestive juices, and at the same time it breaks up the
    food by dissolving the soluble portions, so that its elements are more
    readily acted upon by the digestive fluids. Cookery, however, often
    fails to attain the desired end; and the best material is rendered
    useless and unwholesome by a improper preparation.</p>

<p>It is rare to find a table, some portion of the food upon which is not
    rendered unwholesome either by improper preparatory treatment, or by the
    addition of some deleterious substance. This is doubtless due to the
    fact that the preparation of food being such a commonplace matter, its
    important relations to health, mind, and body have been overlooked, and
    it has been regarded as a menial service which might be undertaken with
    little or no preparation, and without attention to matters other than
    those which relate to the pleasure of the eye and the palate. With taste
    only as a criterion, it is so easy to disguise the results of careless
    and improper cookery of food by the use of flavors and condiments, as
    well as to palm off upon the digestive organs all sorts of inferior
    material, that poor cookery has come to be the rule rather than the
    exception.</p>

<p>Another reason for this prevalence of bad cookery, is to be found in the
    fact that in so many homes the cooking is intrusted to an ignorant class
    of persons having no knowledge whatever of the scientific principles
    involved in this most important and practical of arts. An ethical
    problem which we have been unable to solve is the fact that women who
    would never think of trusting the care of their fine china and
    bric-a-brac to unskilled hands, unhesitatingly intrust to persons who
    are almost wholly untrained, the preparation of their daily food. There
    is no department of life where superior intelligence is more needed than
    in the selection and preparation of food, upon which so largely depend
    the health and physical welfare of the family circle.</p>

<p>The evils of bad cookery and ill-selected food are manifold, so many, in
    fact, that it has been calculated that they far exceed the mischief
    arising from the use of strong drink; indeed, one of the evils of
    unwholesome food is its decided tendency to create a craving for
    intoxicants. Bad cookery causes indigestion, indigestion causes thirst,
    and thirst perpetuates drunkenness. Any one who has suffered from a fit
    of indigestion, and can recollect the accompanying headache and the
    lowness of spirits, varying in degree from dejection or ill-humor to the
    most extreme melancholy, until the intellectual faculties seemed dazed,
    and the moral feelings blunted, will hardly wonder that when such a
    condition becomes chronic, as is often the case from the use of
    improperly prepared food, the victim is easily led to resort to
    stimulants to drown depression and enliven the spirits.</p>

<p>A thorough practical knowledge of simple, wholesome cookery ought to
    form a part of the education of every young woman, whatever her station
    in life. No position in life is more responsible than that of the person
    who arranges the bills of fare and selects the food for the household;
    and what higher mission can one conceive than to intelligently prepare
    the wherewithal to make shoulders strong to bear life's burdens and
    heads clear to solve its intricate problems? what worthier work than to
    help in the building up of bodies into pure temples fit for guests of
    noble thoughts and high purposes? Surely, no one should undertake such
    important work without a knowledge of the principles involved.</p>
