<p class="nonindent">No one thing over which we have control exerts so marked an influence
    upon our physical prosperity as the food we eat; and it is no
    exaggeration to say that well-selected and scientifically prepared food
    renders the partaker whose digestion permits of its being well
    assimilated, superior to his fellow-mortals in those qualities which
    will enable him to cope most successfully with life's difficulties, and
    to fulfill the purpose of existence in the best and truest manner. The
    brain and other organs of the body are affected by the quality of the
    blood which nourishes them, and since the blood is made of the food
    eaten, it follows that the use of poor food will result in poor blood,
    poor muscles, poor brains, and poor bodies, incapable of first-class
    work in any capacity. Very few persons, however, ever stop to inquire
    what particular foods are best adapted to the manufacture of good blood
    and the maintenance of perfect health; but whatever gratifies the palate
    or is most conveniently obtained, is cooked and eaten without regard to
    its dietetic value. Far too many meals partake of the characteristics of
    the one described in the story told of a clergyman who, when requested
    to ask a blessing upon a dinner consisting of bread, hot and tinged with
    saleratus, meat fried to a crisp, potatoes swimming in grease, mince
    pie, preserves, and pickles, demurred on the ground that the dinner was
    "not worth a blessing." He might with equal propriety have added, "and
    not worth eating."</p>

<p>The subject of diet and its relation to human welfare, is one deserving
    of the most careful consideration. It should be studied as a science, to
    enable us to choose such materials as are best adapted to our needs
    under the varying circumstances of climate growth, occupation, and the
    numerous changing conditions of the human system; as an art, that we may
    become so skilled in the preparation of the articles selected as to make
    them both appetizing and healthful. It is an unfortunate fact that even
    among experienced housekeepers the scientific principles which govern
    the proper preparation of food, are but little understood, and much
    unwholesome cookery is the result. The mechanical mixing of ingredients
    is not sufficient to secure good results; and many of the failures
    attributed to "poor material," "bad luck," and various other subterfuges
    to which cooks ignorance of scientific principles. The common method of
    blindly following recipes, with no knowledge of "the reason why," can
    hardly fail to be often productive of unsatisfactory results, which to
    the uninformed seem quite inexplicable.</p>
    
<p>Cookery, when based upon scientific principles, ceases to be the
    difficult problem it so often appears. Cause and effect follow each
    other as certainly in the preparation of food as in other things; and
    with a knowledge of the underlying principles, and faithfulness in
    carrying out the necessary details, failure becomes almost an
    impossibility. There is no department of human activity where applied
    science offers greater advantages than in that of cookery, and in our
    presentation of the subjects treated in the following pages, we have
    endeavored, so far as consistent with the scope of this work, to give
    special prominence to the scientific principles involved in the
    successful production of wholesome articles of food. We trust our
    readers will find these principles so plainly elucidated and the subject
    so interesting, that they will be stimulated to undertake for
    themselves further study and research in this most important branch of
    household science. We have aimed also to give special precedence of
    space to those most important foods, the legumes, and grains and their
    products, which in the majority of cook books are given but little
    consideration or are even left out altogether, believing that our
    readers will be more interested in learning the many palatable ways in
    which these especially nutritious and inexpensive foods may be prepared,
    than in a reiteration of such dishes as usually make up the bulk of the
    average cook book.</p>
    
<p>For reasons stated elsewhere (in the chapter on Milk, Cream, and
    Butter), we have in the preparation of all recipes made use of cream in
    place of other fats; but lest there be some who may suppose because
    cream occupies so frequent a place in the recipes, and because of their
    inability to obtain that article, the recipes are therefore not adapted
    to their use, we wish to state that a large proportion of the recipes in
    which it is mentioned as seasoning, or for dressing, will be found to be
    very palatable with the cream omitted, or by the use of its place of
    some one of the many substitutes recommended. We ought also to mention
    in this connection, that wherever cream is recommended, unless otherwise
    designated, the quality used in the preparation of the recipes is that
    of single or twelve hour cream sufficiently diluted with milk, so that
    one fourth of each quart of milk is reckoned as cream. If a richer
    quality than this be used, the quantity should be diminished in
    proportion; otherwise, by the excess of fat, a wholesome food may become
    a rich, unhealthful dish.</p>
    
<p>In conclusion, the author desires to state that no recipe has been
    admitted to this work which has not been thoroughly tested by repeated
    trials, by far the larger share of such being original, either in the
    combination of the materials used, the method employed, or both
    materials and method. Care has been taken not to cumber the work with
    useless and indifferent recipes. It is believed that every recipe will
    be found valuable, and that the variety offered is sufficiently ample,
    so that under the most differing circumstances, all may be well served.</p>
    
<p>We trust therefore that those who undertake to use the work as a guide
    in their culinary practice, will not consider any given recipe a failure
    because success does not attend their first efforts. Perseverance and a
    careful study of the directions given, will assuredly bring success to
    all who possess the natural or acquired qualities essential for the
    practice of that most useful of the arts,&#8212;"Healthful Cookery."</p>
