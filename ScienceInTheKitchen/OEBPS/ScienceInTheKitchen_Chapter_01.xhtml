<p class="nonindent">The purposes of food are to promote growth, to supply force and heat,
    and to furnish material to repair the waste which is constantly taking
    place in the body. Every breath, every thought, every motion, wears out
    some portion of the delicate and wonderful house in which we live.
    Various vital processes remove these worn and useless particles; and to
    keep the body in health, their loss must be made good by constantly
    renewed supplies of material properly adapted to replenish the worn and
    impaired tissues. This renovating material must be supplied through the
    medium of food and drink, and the best food is that by which the desired
    end may be most readily and perfectly attained. The great diversity in
    character of the several tissues of the body, makes it necessary that
    food should contain a variety of elements, in order that each part may
    be properly nourished and replenished.</p>

<h2>The Food Elements</h2>

<p class="nonindent">The various elements found in food are the
    following: Starch<a role="doc-noteref" href="#foot01" id="num01"><sup>1</sup></a>, 
    sugar<a role="doc-noteref" href="#foot02" id="num02"><sup>2</sup></a>, 
    fats<a role="doc-noteref" href="#foot03" id="num03"><sup>3</sup></a>, 
    albumen<a role="doc-noteref" href="#foot04" id="num04"><sup>4</sup></a>, 
    mineral substances<a role="doc-noteref" href="#foot05" id="num05"><sup>5</sup></a>,
    indigestible substances.</p>

<p>The digestible food elements are often grouped, according to their
    chemical composition, into three classes; <i>vis.</i>, carbonaceous,
    nitrogenous, and inorganic. The carbonaceous class includes starch,
    sugar, and fats; the nitrogenous, all albuminous elements; and the
    inorganic comprises the mineral elements.</p>
    
<p><i>Starch</i> is only found in vegetable foods; all grains, most vegetables,
    and some fruits, contain starch in abundance. Several kinds of <i>sugar</i>
    are made in nature's laboratory; <i>cane</i>, <i>grape</i>, <i>fruit</i>, and <i>milk</i>
    sugar. The first is obtained from the sugar-cane, the sap of maple
    trees, and from the beet root. Grape and fruit sugars are found in most
    fruits and in honey. Milk sugar is one of the constituents of milk.
    Glucose, an artificial sugar resembling grape sugar, is now largely
    manufactured by subjecting the starch of corn or potatoes to a chemical
    process; but it lacks the sweetness of natural sugars, and is by no
    means a proper substitute for them. <i>Albumen</i> is found in its purest,
    uncombined state in the white of an egg, which is almost wholly composed
    of albumen. It exists, combined with other food elements, in many other
    foods, both animal and vegetable. It is found abundant in oatmeal, and
    to some extent in the other grains, and in the juices of vegetables. All
    natural foods contain elements which in many respects resemble
    <i>albumen</i>, and are so closely allied to it that for convenience they are
    usually classified under the general name of "albumen." The chief of
    these is <i>gluten</i>, which is found in wheat, rye, and barley. <i>Casein</i>,
    found in peas, beans, and milk, and the <i>fibrin</i> of flesh, are elements
    of this class.</p>
    
<p><i>Fats</i> are found in both animal and vegetable foods. Of animal fats,
    butter and suet are common examples. In vegetable form, fat is abundant
    in nuts, peas, beans, in various of the grains, and in a few fruits, as
    the olive. As furnished by nature in nuts, legumes, grains, fruits, and
    milk, this element is always found in a state of fine subdivision, which
    condition is the one best adapted to its digestion. As most commonly
    used, in the form of free fats, as butter, lard, etc., it is not only
    difficult of digestion itself, but often interferes with the digestion
    of the other food elements which are mixed with it. It was doubtless
    never intended that fats should be so modified from their natural
    condition and separated from other food elements as to be used as a
    separate article of food. The same may be said of the other carbonaceous
    elements, sugar and starch, neither of which, when used alone, is
    capable of sustaining life, although when combined in a proper and
    natural manner with other food elements, they perform a most important
    part in the nutrition of the body. Most foods contain a percentage of
    the <i>mineral</i> elements. Grains and milk furnish these elements in
    abundance. The cellulose, or woody tissue, of vegetables, and the bran
    of wheat, are examples of <i>indigestible</i> elements, which although they
    cannot be converted into blood in tissue, serve an important purpose by
    giving bulk to the food.</p>
    
<p>With the exception of gluten, none of the food elements, when used
    alone, are capable of supporting life. A true food substance contains
    some of all the food elements, the amount of each varying in different
    foods.</p>

<h2>Uses of the Food Elements</h2>

<p class="nonindent">Concerning the purpose which these
    different elements serve, it has been demonstrated by the experiments of
    eminent physiologists that the carbonaceous elements, which in general
    comprise the greater bulk of the food, serve three purposes in the body:</p>

<ol>
    <li>They furnish material for the production of heat.</li>
    <li>They are a source of force when taken in connection with other food
        elements.</li>
    <li>They replenish the fatty tissues of the body. Of the carbonaceous
        elements,&#8212;starch, sugar, and fats,&#8212;fats produce the greatest amount of
        heat in proportion to quantity; that is, more heat is developed from a
        pound of fat than from an equal weight of sugar or starch; but this
        apparent advantage is more than counterbalanced by the fact that fats
        are much more difficult of digestion than are the other carbonaceous
        elements, and if relied upon to furnish adequate material for bodily
        heat, would be productive of much mischief in overtaxing and producing
        disease of the digestive organs. The fact that nature has made a much
        more ample provision of starch and sugars than of fats in man's natural
        diet, would seem to indicate that they were intended to be the chief
        source of carbonaceous food; nevertheless, fats, when taken in such
        proportion as nature supplies them, are necessary and important food
        elements.</li>
</ol>
    
<p>The nitrogenous food elements especially nourish the brain, nerves,
    muscles, and all the more highly vitalized and active tissues of the
    body, and also serve as a stimulus to tissue change. Hence it may be
    said that a food deficient in these elements is a particularly poor
    food.</p>
    
<p>The inorganic elements, chief of which are the phosphates, in the
    carbonates of potash, soda, and lime, aid in furnishing the requisite
    building material for bones and nerves.</p>

<h2>Proper Combinations of Foods</h2>

<p class="nonindent">While it is important that our food
    should contain some of all the various food elements, experiments upon
    both animals and human beings show it is necessary that these elements,
    especially the nitrogenous and carbonaceous, be used in certain definite
    proportions, as the system is only able to appropriate a certain amount
    of each; and all excess, especially of nitrogenous elements, is not only
    useless, but even injurious, since to rid the system of the surplus
    imposes an additional task upon the digestive and excretory organs. The
    relative proportion of these elements necessary to constitute a food
    which perfectly meets the requirements of the system, is six of
    carbonaceous to one of nitrogenous. Scientists have devoted much careful
    study and experimentation to the determination of the quantities of each
    of the food elements required for the daily nourishment of individuals
    under the varying conditions of life, and it has come to be commonly
    accepted that of the nitrogenous material which should constitute one
    sixth of the nutrients taken, about <i>three ounces</i> is all that can be
    made use of in twenty-four hours, by a healthy adult of average weight,
    doing a moderate amount of work. Many articles of food are, however,
    deficient in one or the other of these elements, and need to be
    supplemented by other articles containing the deficient element in
    superabundance, since to employ a dietary in which any one of the
    nutritive elements is lacking, although in bulk it may be all the
    digestive organs can manage, is really starvation, and will in time
    occasion serious results.</p>
    
<p>It is thus apparent that much care should be exercised in the selection
    and combination of food materials. The table on page 484, showing the
    nutritive values of various foods, should be carefully studied. Such
    knowledge is of first importance in the education of cooks and
    housekeepers, since to them falls the selection of the food for the
    daily needs of the household; and they should not only understand what
    foods are best suited to supply these needs, but how to combine them in
    accordance with physiological laws.</p>

<h2>Condiments</h2>

<p class="nonindent">By condiments are commonly meant such substances as
    are added to season food, to give it "a relish" or to stimulate
    appetite, but which in themselves possess no real food value. To this
    category belong mustard, ginger, pepper, pepper sauce, Worcestershire
    sauce, cloves, spices, and other similar substances. That anything is
    needed to disguise or improve the natural flavor of food, would seem to
    imply either that the article used was not a proper alimentary
    substance, or that it did not answer the purpose for which the Creator
    designed it. True condiments, such as pepper, pepper sauce, ginger,
    spice, mustard, cinnamon, cloves, etc., are all strong irritants. This
    may be readily demonstrated by their application to a raw surface. The
    intense smarting and burning occasioned are ample evidence of the
    irritating character. Pepper and mustard are capable of producing
    powerfully irritating effects, even when applied to the healthy skin
    where wholly intact. It is surprising that it does not occur to the
    mother who applies a mustard plaster to the feet of her child, to
    relieve congestion of the brain, that an article which is capable of
    producing a blister upon the external covering of the body, is quite as
    capable of producing similar effects when applied to the more sensitive
    tissues within the body. The irritating effects of these substances upon
    the stomach are not readily recognized, simply because the stomach is
    supplied with very few nerves of sensation. That condiments induce an
    intense degree of irritation of the mucous membrane of the stomach, was
    abundantly demonstrated by the experiments of Dr. Beaumont upon the
    unfortunate Alexis St. Martin. Dr. Beaumont records that when St. Martin
    took mustard, pepper, and similar condiments with his food, the mucous
    membrane of his stomach became intensely red and congested, appearing
    very much like an inflamed eye. It is this irritating effect of
    condiments which gives occasion for their extended use. They create an
    artificial appetite, similar to the incessant craving of the chronic
    dyspeptic, whose irritable stomach is seldom satisfied. This fact with
    regard to condiments is a sufficient argument against their use, being
    one of the greatest causes of gluttony, since they remove the sense of
    satiety by which Nature says, "Enough."</p>

<p>To a thoroughly normal and unperverted taste, irritating condiments of
    all sorts are very obnoxious. It is true that Nature accommodates
    herself to their use with food to such a degree that they may be
    employed for years without apparently producing very grave results; but
    this very condition is a source of injury, since it is nothing more nor
    less than the going to sleep of the sentinels which nature has posted at
    the portal of the body, for the purpose of giving warning of danger. The
    nerves of sensibility have become benumbed to such a degree that they no
    longer offer remonstrance against irritating substances, and allow the
    enemy to enter into the citadel of life. The mischievous work is thus
    insidiously carried on year after year until by and by the individual
    breaks down with some chronic disorder of the liver, kidneys, or some
    other important internal organ. Physicians have long observed that in
    tropical countries where curry powder and other condiments are very
    extensively used, diseases of the liver, especially acute congestion and
    inflammation, are exceedingly common, much more so that in countries and
    among nations where condiments are less freely used. A traveler in
    Mexico, some time ago, described a favorite Mexican dish as composed of
    layers of the following ingredients: "Pepper, mustard, ginger, pepper,
    potato, ginger; mustard, pepper, potato, mustard, ginger, pepper." The
    common use of such a dish is sufficient cause for the great frequency of
    diseases of the liver among the Mexicans, noted by physicians traveling
    in that country. That the use of condiments is wholly a matter of habit
    is evident from the fact that different nations employ as condiments
    articles which would be in the highest degree obnoxious to people of
    other countries. For example, the garlic so freely used in Russian
    cookery, would be considered by Americans no addition to the natural
    flavors of food; and still more distasteful would be the asafetida
    frequently used as a seasoning in the cuisine of Persia and other
    Asiatic countries.</p>

<p>The use of condiments is unquestionably a strong auxiliary to the
    formation of a habit of using intoxicating drinks. Persons addicted to
    the use of intoxicating liquors are, as a rule, fond of stimulating and
    highly seasoned foods; and although the converse is not always true, yet
    it is apparent to every thoughtful person, that the use of a diet
    composed of highly seasoned and irritating food, institutes the
    conditions necessary for the acquirement of a taste for intoxicating
    liquors. The false appetite aroused by the use of food that "burns and
    stings," craves something less insipid than pure cold water to keep up
    the fever the food has excited. Again, condiments, like all other
    stimulants, must be continually increased in quantity, or their effect
    becomes diminished; and this leads directly to a demand for stronger
    stimulants, both in eating and drinking, until the probable tendency is
    toward the dram-shop.</p>

<p>A more serious reason why high seasonings leads to intemperance, is in
    the perversion of the use of the sense of taste. Certain senses are
    given us to add to our pleasure as well as for the practical, almost
    indispensable, use they are to us. For instance, the sense of sight is
    not only useful, but enables us to drink in beauty, if among beautiful
    surroundings, without doing us any harm. The same of music and other
    harmonics which may come to us through the sense of hearing. But the
    sense of taste and was given us to distinguish between wholesome and
    unwholesome foods, and cannot be used for merely sensuous gratification,
    without debasing and making of it a gross thing. An education which
    demands special enjoyment or pleasure through the sense of taste, is
    wholly artificial; it is coming down to the animal plane, or below it
    rather; for the instinct of the brute creation teaches it merely to eat
    to live.</p>

<p>Yet how wide-spread is this habit of sensuous gratification through the
    sense of taste! If one calls upon a neighbor, he is at once offered
    refreshments of some kind, as though the greatest blessing of life came
    from indulging the appetite. This evil is largely due to wrong
    education, which begins with childhood. When Johnnie sits down to the
    table, the mother says, "Johnnie, what would you like?" instead of
    putting plain, wholesome food before the child, and taking it as a
    matter of course that he will eat it and be satisfied. The child grows
    to think that he must have what he likes, whether it is good for him or
    not. It is not strange that an appetite thus pampered in childhood
    becomes uncontrollable at maturity; for the step from gormandizing to
    intoxication is much shorter than most people imagine. The natural,
    unperverted taste of a child will lead him to eat that which is good for
    him. But how can we expect the children to reform when the parents
    continually set them bad examples in the matter of eating and drinking?</p>

<p>The cultivation of a taste for spices is a degradation of the sense of
    taste. Nature never designed that pleasure should be divorced from use.
    The effects of gratifying the sense of taste differ materially from
    those of gratifying the higher senses of sight and hearing. What we see
    is gone; nothing remains but the memory, and the same is true of the
    sweetest sounds which may reach us through the ears. But what we taste
    is taken into the stomach and what has thus given us brief pleasure
    through the gratification of the palate, must make work in the
    alimentary canal for fourteen hours before it is disposed of.</p>

<h2>Variety in Food</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Simplicity of diet should be a point of first
    consideration with all persons upon whom falls the responsibility of
    providing the family bills of fare, since the simplest foods are, as a
    rule, the most healthful. Variety is needed; that is, a judicious
    mingling of fruits, grains, and vegetables; but the general tendency is
    to supply our tables with too many kinds and to prepare each dish in the
    most elaborate manner, until, in many households, the cooking of food
    has come to be almost the chief end of life. While the preparation of
    food should be looked upon as of so much importance as to demand the
    most careful consideration and thought as to its suitability,
    wholesomeness, nutritive qualities, and digestibility, it should by no
    means be made to usurp the larger share of one's time, when simpler
    foods and less labor would afford the partakers equal nourishment and
    strength.</p>

<p>A great variety of foods at one meal exerts a potent influence in
    creating a love of eating, and is likewise a constant temptation to
    overeat. Let us have well-cooked, nutritious, and palatable food, and
    plenty of it; variety from day to day, but not too great a variety at
    each meal.</p>

<p>The prevalent custom of loading the table with a great number of viands,
    upon occasions when guests are to be entertained in our homes, is one to
    be deplored, since it is neither conducive to good health nor necessary
    to good cheer, but on the contrary is still laborious and expensive a
    practice that many are debarred from social intercourse because they
    cannot afford to entertain after the fashion of their neighbors. Upon
    this subject a well-known writer has aptly said:</p>

<blockquote>"Simplify cookery, thus
    reducing the cost of living, and how many longing individuals would
    thereby be enabled to afford themselves the pleasure of culture and
    social intercourse! When the barbarous practice of stuffing one's guests
    shall have been abolished, a social gathering will not then imply, as it
    does now, hard labor, expensive outlay, and dyspepsia. Perhaps when that
    time arise, we shall be sufficiently civilized to demand pleasures of a
    higher sort. True, the entertainments will then, in one sense, be more
    costly, as culture is harder to come by than cake. The profusion of
    viands now heaped upon the table, betrays poverty of the worst sort.
    Having nothing better to offer, we offer victuals; and this we do with
    something of that complacent, satisfied air with which some more
    northern tribes present their tidbits of whale and walrus."</blockquote>

<h2>The Digestion of Foods</h2>

<p>It is important that the housekeeper not only understand the nature and
    composition of foods, but she should also know something of their
    digestive properties, since food, to be serviceable, must be not only
    nutritious, but easily digested. Digestion is the process by which food
    rendered soluble, and capable of being absorbed for use in carrying on
    the various vital processes.</p>

<p>The digestive apparatus consists of a long and tortuous tube called the
    alimentary canal, varying in length from twenty-five to thirty feet,
    along which are arranged the various digestive organs,&#8212;the mouth, the
    stomach, the liver, and the pancreas,&#8212;each of which, together with the
    intestines, has an important function to perform. In these various
    organs nature manufactures five wonderful fluids for changing and
    dissolving the several food elements. The mouth supplies the saliva; in
    the walls of the stomach are little glands which produce the gastric
    juice; the pancreatic juice is made by the pancreas; the liver secretes
    bile; while scattered along the small intestines are minute glands
    which make the intestinal juice. Each of these fluids has a particular
    work to do in transforming some part of the food into suitable material
    for use in the body. The saliva acts upon the starch of the food,
    changing it into sugar; the gastric juice digests albumin and other
    nitrogenous elements; the bile digests fat, and aids in the absorption
    of other food elements after they are digested; the pancreatic juice is
    not confined in its action to a single element, but digests starch,
    fats, and the albuminous elements after they have been acted upon by the
    gastric juice; the intestinal juice is capable of acting upon all
    digestible food elements.</p>

<h2>The Digestion of a Mouthful of Bread</h2>

<p class="nonindent">A mouthful of bread
    represents all, or nearly all, the elements of nutrition. Taking a
    mouthful of bread as a representative of food in general, it may be said
    that its digestion begins the moment that it enters the mouth, and
    continues the entire length of the alimentary canal, or until the
    digestible portion of the food has been completely digested and
    absorbed. We quote the following brief description of the digestive
    process from Dr. J.H. Kellogg's Second Book in Physiology:</p>

<blockquote>"<em>Mastication.</em>&#8212;
    The first act of the digestive process is mastication,
    or chewing the food, the purpose of which is to crush the food and
    divide it into small particles, so that the various digestive fluids may
    easily and promptly come into contact with every part of it.</blockquote>
   
<blockquote>"<em>Salivary Digestion.</em>&#8212;
    During the mastication of the food, the salivary
    glands are actively pouring out the saliva, which mingles with the food,
    and by softening it, aids in its division and prepares it for the action
    of the other digestive fluids. It also acts upon the starch, converting
    a portion of it into grape-sugar.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<em>Stomach Digestion.</em>&#8212;
    After receiving the food, the stomach soon begins
    to pour out the gastric juices, which first makes its appearance in
    little drops, like beads of sweat upon the face when the perspiration
    starts. As the quantity increases, the drops run together, trickle down
    the side of the stomach, and mingle with the food. The muscular walls of
    the stomach contract upon the food, moving it about with a sort of
    crushing action, thoroughly mixing the gastric juice with the food.
    During this process both the openings of the stomach are closed tightly.
    The gastric juice softens the food, digests albumen, and coagulates
    milk. The saliva continues its action upon starch for sometime after the
    food reaches the stomach.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the food has remained in the stomach from one to three hours, or
    even longer, if the digestion is slow, or indigestible foods have been
    eaten, the contractions of the stomach become so vigorous that the more
    fluid portions of the food are squeezed out through the pylorus, the
    lower orifice of the stomach, thus escaping into the intestine. The
    pylorus does not exercise any sort of intelligence in the selection of
    food, as was once supposed. The increasing acidity of the contents of
    the stomach causes its muscular walls to contract with increasing
    vigor, until finally those portions of the food which may be less
    perfectly broken up, but which the stomach has been unable to digest,
    are forced through the pylorus.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<em>Intestinal Digestion.</em>&#8212;
    As it leaves the stomach, the partially
    digested mass of food is intensely acid, from the large quantity of
    gastric juices which it contains. Intestinal digestion cannot begin
    until the food becomes alkaline. The alkaline bile neutralizes the
    gastric juice, and renders the digesting mass slightly alkaline. The
    bile also acts upon the fatty elements of the food, converting them into
    an emulsion. The pancreatic juice converts the starch into grape-sugar,
    even acting upon raw starch. It also digest fats and albumem. The
    intestinal juice continues the work begun by the other digestive fluids,
    and, in addition, digests cane-sugar, converting it into grape-sugar.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<em>Other Uses of the Digestive Fluids.</em>&#8212;
    In addition to the uses which we
    have already stated, several of the digestive fluids possess other
    interesting properties. The saliva aids the stomach by stimulating its
    glands to make gastric juice. The gastric juice and the bile are
    excellent antiseptics, by which the food is preserved from fermentation
    while undergoing digestion. The bile also stimulates the movements of
    the intestines by which the food is moved along, and aids absorption. It
    is remarkable and interesting that a fluid so useful as the bile should
    be at the same time composed of waste matters which are being removed
    from the body. This is an illustration of the wonderful economy shown by
    nature in her operations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The food is moved along the alimentary canal, from the stomach
    downward, by successive contractions of the muscular walls of the
    intestines, known as peristaltic movements, which occur with great
    regularity during digestion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<em>Absorption.</em>&#8212;
    The absorption of the food begins as soon as any portion
    has been digested. Even in the mouth and the esophagus a small amount is
    absorbed. The entire mucous membrane lining the digestive canal is
    furnished with a rich supply of blood-vessels, by which the greater part
    of the digestive food is absorbed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<em>Liver Digestion.</em>&#8212;
    The liver as well as the stomach is a digestive
    organ, and in a double sense. It not only secretes a digestive fluid,
    the bile, but it acts upon the food brought to it by the portal vein,
    and regulates the supply of digested food to the general system. It
    converts a large share of the grape-sugar and partially digested starch
    brought to it into a kind of liver starch, termed glycogen, which it
    stores up in its tissues. During the interval between the meals, the
    liver gradually redigests the glycogen, reconverting it into sugar, and
    thus supplying it to the blood in small quantities, instead of allowing
    the entire amount formed in digestion to enter the circulation at once.
    If too large an amount of sugar entered the system at once, it would be
    unable to use it all, and would be compelled to get rid of a
    considerable portion through the kidneys. The liver also completes the
    digestion of albumen and other food elements."</blockquote>

<h2>Time Required for Digestion</h2>

<p class="nonindent">The length of time required for
    stomach digestion varies with different food substances. The following
    table shows the time necessary for the stomach digestion of some of the
    more commonly used foods:</p>

<p>The time required for the digestion of food also depends upon the
    condition under which the food is eaten. Healthy stomach digestion
    requires at least five hours for its completion, and the stomach should
    have an hour for rest before another meal. If fresh food is taken before
    that which preceded it is digested, the portion of food remaining in the
    stomach is likely to undergo fermentation, thus rendering the whole mass
    of food unfit for the nutrition of the body, besides fostering various
    disturbances of digestion. It has been shown by recent observations that
    the length of time required for food to pass through the entire
    digestive process to which it is subjected in the mouth, stomach, and
    small intestines, is from twelve to fourteen hours.</p>

<h2>Hygiene of Digestion</h2>

<p class="nonindent">With the stomach and other digestive organs
    in a state of perfect health, one is entirely unconscious of their
    existence, save when of feeling of hunger calls attention to the fact
    that food is required, or satiety warns us that a sufficient amount or
    too much has been eaten. Perfect digestion can only be maintained by
    careful observance of the rules of health in regard to habits of eating.</p>

<p>On the subject of Hygiene of Digestion, we again quote a few paragraphs
    from Dr. Kellogg's work on Physiology, in which is given a concise
    summary of the more important points relating to this:</p>

<blockquote>"The hygiene of digestion has to do with the quality and quantity of
    food eaten, in the manner of eating it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<em>Hasty Eating.</em>&#8212;
    If the food is eaten too rapidly, it will not be
    properly divided, and when swallowed in coarse lumps, the digestive
    fluids cannot readily act upon it. On account of the insufficient
    mastication, the saliva will be deficient in quantity, and, as a
    consequence, the starch will not be well digested, and the stomach will
    not secrete a sufficient amount of gastric juice. It is not well to eat
    only soft or liquid food, as we are likely to swallow it without proper
    chewing. A considerable proportion of hard food, which requires thorough
    mastication, should be eaten at every meal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<em>Drinking Freely at Meals</em> is harmful, as it not only encourages hasty
    eating, but dilutes the gastric juice, and thus lessens its activity.
    The food should be chewed until sufficiently moistened by saliva to
    allow it to be swallowed. When large quantities of fluid are taken into
    the stomach, digestion does not begin until a considerable portion of
    the fluid has been absorbed. If cold foods or drinks are taken with the
    meal, such as ice-cream, ice-water, iced milk or tea, the stomach is
    chilled, and a long delay in the digestive process is occasioned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Indians of Brazil carefully abstain from drinking when eating, and
    the same custom prevails among many other savage tribes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<em>Eating between Meals.</em>&#8212;
    The habit of eating apples, nuts, fruits,
    confectionery, etc., between meals is exceedingly harmful, and certain
    to produce loss of appetite and indigestion. The stomach as well as the
    muscles and other organs of the body requires rest. The frequency with
    which meals should be taken depends somewhat upon the age and occupation
    of an individual. Infants take their food at short intervals, and owing
    to its simple character, are able to digest it very quickly. Adults
    should not take food oftener than three times a day; and persons whose
    employment is sedentary say, in many cases at least, adopt with
    advantage the plan of the ancient Greeks, who ate but twice a day. The
    latter custom is quite general among the higher classes in France and
    Spain, and in several South American countries.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<em>Simplicity in Diet.</em>&#8212;
    Taking too many kinds of food at a meal is a
    common fault which is often a cause of disease of the digestive-organs.
    Those nations are the most hardy and enduring whose dietary is most
    simple. The Scotch peasantry live chiefly upon oatmeal, the Irish upon
    potatoes, milk, and oatmeal, the Italian upon peas, beans, macaroni, and
    chestnuts; yet all these are noted for remarkable health and endurance.
    The natives of the Canary Islands, an exceedingly well-developed and
    vigorous race, subsist almost chiefly upon a food which they call
    gofio, consisting of parched grain, coarsely ground in a mortar and
    mixed with water.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<em>Eating when Tired.</em>&#8212;
    It is not well to eat when exhausted by violent
    exercise, as the system is not prepared to do the work of digestion
    well. Sleeping immediately after eating is also a harmful practice. The
    process of digestion cannot well be performed during sleep, and sleep is
    disturbed by the ineffective efforts of the digestive organs. Hence the
    well-known evil effects of late suppers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<em>Excess of Certain Food Elements.</em>&#8212;
    When sugar is too freely used,
    either with food or in the form of sweetmeats or candies, indigestion,
    and even more serious disease, is likely to result. Fats, when freely
    used, give rise to indigestion and 'biliousness.' An excess of albumen
    from the too free use of meat is harmful. Only a limited amount of this
    element can be used; an excess is treated as waste matter, and must be
    removed from the system by the liver and the kidneys. The majority of
    persons would enjoy better health by using meat more moderately than is
    customary in this country.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<em>Deficiency of Certain Food Elements.</em>&#8212;
    A diet deficient in any
    important food element is even more detrimental to health than a diet in
    which certain elements are in excess.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The popular notion that beef-tea and meat extracts contain the
    nourishing elements of meat in a concentrated form, is a dangerous
    error. Undoubtedly many sick persons have been starved by being fed
    exclusively upon these articles, which are almost wholly composed of
    waste substances. Prof. Paule Bernard, of Paris, found that dogs fed
    upon meat extracts died sooner than those which received only water."</blockquote>

<h2>Food Combinations</h2>

<p class="nonindent">Some persons, especially those of weak
    digestive powers, often experience inconvenience in the use of certain
    foods, owing to their improper combinations with other articles. Many
    foods which are digested easily when partaken of alone or in harmonious
    combinations, create much disturbance when eaten at the same meal with
    several different articles of food, or with some particular article with
    which they are especially incompatible. The following food combinations
    are among the best, the relative excellence of each being indicated by
    the order in which they are named: Milk and grains; grains and eggs;
    grains and vegetables or meats; grains and fruits.</p>

<p>Persons with sound stomachs and vigorous digestion will seldom
    experience inconvenience in making use of other and more varied
    combinations, but dyspeptics and persons troubled with slow digestion
    will find it to their advantage to select from the bill of fare such
    articles as best accord with each other, and to avoid such combinations
    as fruits and vegetables, milk and vegetables, milk and meats, sugar and
    milk, meat or vegetables, fats with fruits, meats, or vegetables, or
    cooked with grains.</p>
