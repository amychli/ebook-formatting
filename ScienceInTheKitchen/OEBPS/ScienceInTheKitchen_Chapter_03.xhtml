<h1>The Principles of Scentific Cookery</h1>

<div class="dingbat">

</div>

<p class="nonindent">Cookery is the art of preparing food for the table by dressing, or by
    the application of heat in some manner.</p>

<h2>Fuels</h2>

<p class="nonindent">Artificial heat is commonly produced by combustion, caused
    by the chemical action of the oxygen of the air upon the hydrogen and
    carbon found in fuel. The different fuels in common use for cooking
    purposes are hard wood, soft wood, charcoal, anthracite coal, bituminous
    coal, coke, lignite, kerosene oil, gasoline, and gas. As to their
    respective values, much depends upon the purpose for which they are to
    be used. Wood charcoal produces a greater amount of heat than an equal
    weight of any other fuel. Soft wood burns quicker and gives a more
    intense heat than hard wood, and hence is best for a quick fire. Hard
    wood burns slowly, produces a larger mass of coals, and is best where
    long-continued heat is desired. Anthracite coal kindles slowly, and
    burns with little flame or smoke, but its vapor is sulphurous, and on
    that account it should never be burned in an open stove, nor in one with
    an imperfect draft. Its heat is steady and intense. Bituminous coal
    ignites readily, burns with considerable flame and smoke, and gives a
    much less intense heat than anthracite, Lignite, or brown coal, is much
    less valuable as fuel. Coke is useful when a short, quick fire is
    needed. Kerosene and gas are convenient and economical fuels.</p>

<h2>Making Fires</h2>

<p class="nonindent">If coal is the fuel to be used, first clean out the
    stove by shaking the grate and removing all ashes and cinders. Remove
    the stove covers, and brush the soot and ashes out of all the flues and
    draft holes into the fire-box. Place a large handful of shavings or
    loosely twisted or crumpled papers upon the grate, over which lay some
    fine pieces of dry kindling-wood, arranged crosswise to permit a free
    draft, then a few sticks of hard wood, so placed as to allow plenty of
    air spaces. Be sure that the wood extends out to both ends of the
    fire-box. Replace the covers, and if the stove needs blacking, mix the
    polish, and apply it, rubbing with a dry brush until nearly dry, then
    light the fuel, as a little heat will facilitate the polishing. When the
    wood is burning briskly, place a shovelful or two of rather small pieces
    of coal upon the wood, and, as they ignite, gradually add more, until
    there is a clear, bright body of fire, remembering, however, never to
    fill the stove above the fire bricks; then partly close the direct
    draft. When wood or soft coal is used, the fuel may be added at the same
    time with the kindling.</p>

<h2>Care of Fires</h2>

<p class="nonindent">Much fuel is wasted through the loss of heat from
    too much draft. Only just enough air should be supplied to promote
    combustion. A coal fire, when well kindled, needs only air enough to
    keep it burning. When the coal becomes red all through, it has parted
    with the most of its heat, and the fire will soon die unless
    replenished. To keep a steady fire, add but a small amount of fuel at a
    time, and repeat often enough to prevent any sensible decrease of the
    degree of heat. Rake the fire from the bottom, and keep it clear of
    ashes and cinders. If a very hot fire is needed, open the drafts; at
    other times, keep them closed, or partially so, and not waste fuel.
    There is no economy in allowing a fire to get low before fuel is added;
    for the fresh fuel cools the fire to a temperature so low that it is not
    useful, and thus occasions a direct waste of all fuel necessary to again
    raise the heat to the proper degree, to say nothing of the waste of time
    and patience. The addition of small quantities of fuel at short
    intervals so long as continuous heat is needed, is far better than to
    let the fuel burn nearly out, and then add a larger quantity. The
    improper management of the drafts and dampers has also much to do with
    waste of fuel. As stoves are generally constructed, it is necessary for
    the heat to pass over the top, down the back, and under the bottom of
    the oven before escaping into the flue, in order to properly heat the
    oven for baking. In order to force the heat to make this circuit, the
    direct draft of the stove needs to be closed. With this precaution
    observed, a quick fire from a small amount of fuel, used before its
    force is spent, will produce better results than a fire-box full under
    other circumstances.</p>

<p>An item of economy for those who are large users of coal, is the careful
    sifting of the cinders from the ashes. They can be used to good
    advantage to put first upon the kindlings, when building the fire, as
    they ignite more readily than fresh coal, and give a greater, quicker
    heat, although much less enduring.</p>

<h2>Methods of Cooking</h2>

<p class="nonindent">A proper source of heat having been secured,
    the next step is to apply it to the food in some manner. The principal
    methods commonly employed are roasting, broiling, baking, boiling,
    stewing, simmering, steaming, and frying.</p>

<p><em>Roasting</em> is cooking food in its own juices before an open fire. A
    clear fire with intense heat is necessary.</p>

<p><em>Broiling</em>, or <em>grilling</em>, is cooking by radiant heat over glowing
    coals. This method is only adapted to thin pieces of food with a
    considerable amount of surface. Larger and more compact foods should be
    roasted or baked. Roasting and broiling are allied in principle. In
    both, the work is chiefly done by the radiation of heat directly upon
    the surface of the food, although some heat is communicated by the hot
    air surrounding the food. The intense heat applied to the food soon
    sears its outer surfaces, and thus prevents the escape of its juices. If
    care be taken frequently to turn the food so that its entire surface
    will be thus acted upon, the interior of the mass is cooked by its own
    juices.</p>

<p><em>Baking</em> is the cooking of food by dry heat in a closed oven. Only foods
    containing a considerable degree of moisture are adapted for cooking by
    this method. The hot, dry air which fills the oven is always thirsting
    for moisture, and will take from every moist substance to which it has
    access a quantity of water proportionate to its degree of heat. Foods
    containing but a small amount of moisture, unless protected in some
    manner from the action of the heated air, or in some way supplied with
    moisture during the cooking process, come from the oven dry, hard, and
    unpalatable.</p>

<p>Proper cooking by this method depends greatly upon the facility with
    which the heat of the oven can be regulated. When oil or gas is the fuel
    used, it is an easy matter to secure and maintain almost any degree of
    heat desirable, but with a wood or coal stove, especial care and
    painstaking are necessary.</p>

<p>It is of the first importance that the mechanism of the oven to be used,
    be thoroughly understood by the cook, and she should test its heating
    capacity under various conditions, with a light, quick fire and with a
    more steady one; she should carefully note the kind and amount of fuel
    requisite to produce a certain degree of heat; in short, she should
    thoroughly know her "machine" and its capabilities before attempting to
    use it for the cooking of food. An oven thermometer is of the utmost
    value for testing the heat, but unfortunately, such thermometers are not
    common. They are obtainable in England, although quite expensive. It is
    also possible at the present time to obtain ranges with a very reliable
    thermometer attachment to the oven door.</p>

<p>A cook of good judgment by careful observation and comparison of
    results, can soon learn to form quite a correct idea of the heat of her
    oven by the length of time she can hold her hand inside it without
    discomfort, but since much depends upon the construction of stoves and
    the kind of fuel used, and since the degree of heat bearable will vary
    with every hand that tries it, each person who depends upon this test
    must make her own standard. When the heat of the oven is found to be too
    great, it may be lessened by placing in it a dish of cold water.</p>

<p><em>Boiling</em> is the cooking of food in a boiling liquid. Water is the usual
    medium employed for this purpose. When water is heated, as its
    temperature is increased, minute bubbles of air which have been
    dissolved by it are given off. As the temperature rises, bubbles of
    steam will begin to form at the bottom of the vessel. At first these
    will be condensed as they rise into the cooler water above, causing a
    simmering sound; but as the heat increases, the bubbles will rise higher
    and higher before collapsing, and in a short time will pass entirely
    through the water, escaping from its surface, causing more or less
    agitation, according to the rapidity with which they are formed. Water
    boils when the bubbles thus rise to the surface, and steam is thrown
    off. If the temperature is now tested, it will be found to be about 212°
    F. When water begins to boil, it is impossible to increase its
    temperature, as the steam carries off the heat as rapidly as it is
    communicated to the water. The only way in which the temperature can be
    raised, is by the confinement of the steam; but owing to its enormous
    expansive force, this is not practicable with ordinary cooking utensils.
    The mechanical action of the water is increased by rapid bubbling, but
    not the heat; and to boil anything violently does not expedite the
    cooking process, save that by the mechanical action of the water the
    food is broken into smaller pieces, which are for this reason more
    readily softened. But violent boiling occasions an enormous waste of
    fuel, and by driving away in the steam the volatile and savory elements
    of the food, renders it much less palatable, if not altogether
    tasteless. The solvent properties of water are so increased by heat that
    it permeates the food, rendering its hard and tough constituents soft
    and easy of digestion.</p>

<p>The liquids mostly employed in the cooking of foods are water and milk.
    Water is best suited for the cooking of most foods, but for such
    farinaceous foods as rice, macaroni, and farina, milk, or at least part
    milk, is preferable, as it adds to their nutritive value. In using milk
    for cooking purposes, it should be remembered that being more dense than
    water, when heated, less steam escapes, and consequently it boils sooner
    than does water. Then, too, milk being more dense, when it is used alone
    for cooking, a little larger quantity of fluid will be required than
    when water is used.</p>

<p>The boiling point for water at the sea level is 212°. At all points
    above the sea level, water boils at a temperature below 212°, the exact
    temperature depending upon the altitude. At the top of Mt. Blanc, an
    altitude of 15,000 feet, water boils at 185°. The boiling point is
    lowered one degree for every 600 feet increase in altitude. The boiling
    point may be increased by adding soluble substances to the water. A
    saturated solution of common baking soda boils at 220°. A saturated
    solution of chloride of sodium boils at 227°. A similar solution of
    sal-ammoniac boils at 238°. Of course such solutions cannot be used
    advantageously, except as a means of cooking articles placed in
    hermetically sealed vessels and immersed in the liquid.</p>

<p>Different effects upon food are produced by the use of hard and soft
    water. Peas and beans boiled in hard water containing lime or gypsum,
    will not become tender, because these chemical substances harden
    vegetable casein, of which element peas and beans are largely composed.
    For extracting the juices of meat and the soluble parts of other foods,
    soft water is best, as it more readily penetrates the tissue; but when
    it is desired to preserve the articles whole, and retain their juices
    and flavors, hard water is preferable.</p>

<p>Foods should be put to cook in cold or boiling water, in accordance with
    the object to be attained in their cooking. Foods from which it is
    desirable to extract the nutrient properties, as for broths, extracts,
    etc., should be put to cook in cold water. Foods to be kept intact as
    nearly as may be, should be put to cook in boiling water.</p>

<p>Hot and cold water act differently upon the different food elements.
    Starch is but slightly acted upon by cold water. When starch is added
    to several times its bulk of hot water, all the starch granules burst on
    approaching the boiling point, and swell to such a degree as to occupy
    nearly the whole volume of the water, forming a pasty mess. Sugar is
    dissolved readily in the either hot or cold water. Cold water extracts
    albumen. Hot water coagulates it.</p>

<p><em>Steaming</em>, as its name implies, is the cooking of food by the use of
    steam. There are several ways of steaming, the most common of which is
    by placing the food in a perforated dish over a vessel of boiling water.
    For foods not needing the solvent powers of water, or which already
    contain a large amount of moisture, this method is preferable to
    boiling. Another form of cooking, which is usually termed steaming, is
    that of placing the food, with or without water, as needed, in a closed
    vessel which is placed inside another vessel containing boiling water.
    Such an apparatus is termed a double boiler. Food cooked in its own
    juices in a covered dish in a hot oven, is sometimes spoken of as being
    <i>steamed</i> or <i>smothered</i>.</p>

<p><em>Stewing</em> is the prolonged cooking of food in a small quantity of
    liquid, the temperature of which is just below the boiling point.
    Stewing should not be confounded with simmering, which is slow, steady
    boiling. The proper temperature for stewing is most easily secured by
    the use of the double boiler. The water in the outer vessel boils, while
    that in the inner vessel does not, being kept a little below the
    temperature of the water from which its heat is obtained, by the
    constant evaporation at a temperature a little below the boiling point.</p>

<p><em>Frying</em>, which is the cooking of food in hot fat, is a method not to be
    recommended--Unlike all the other food elements, fat is rendered less
    digestible by cooking. Doubtless it is for this reason that nature has
    provided those foods which require the most prolonged cooking to fit
    them for use with only a small proportion of fat, and it would seem to
    indicate that any food to be subjected to a high degree of heat should
    not be mixed and compounded largely of fats. The ordinary way of frying,
    which the French call <i>sauteing</i>, is by the use of only a little fat in
    a shallow pan, into which the food is put and cooked first on one side
    and then the other. Scarcely anything could be more unwholesome than
    food prepared in this manner. A morsel of food encrusted with fat
    remains undigested in the stomach because fat is not acted upon by the
    gastric juice, and its combination with the other food elements of which
    the morsel is composed interferes with their digestion also. If such
    foods are habitually used, digestion soon becomes slow and the gastric
    juice so deficient in quantity that fermentation and putrefactive
    changes are occasioned, resulting in serious disturbance of health. In
    the process of frying, the action of the heat partially decomposes the
    fat; in consequence, various poisonous substances are formed, highly
    detrimental to the digestion of the partaker of the food.</p>

<h2>Adding Foods to Boiling Liquids</h2>

<p class="nonindent">Much of the soddenness of
    improperly cooked foods might be avoided, if the following facts were
    kept in mind:</p>

<p>When vegetables, or other foods of ordinary temperature, are put into
    boiling water, the temperature of the water is lowered in proportion to
    the quantity and the temperature of the food thus introduced, and will
    not again boil until the mass of food shall have absorbed more heat from
    the fire. The result of this is that the food is apt to become more or
    less water-soaked before the process of cooking begins. This difficulty
    may be avoided by introducing but small quantities of the food at one
    time, so as not to greatly lower the temperature of the liquid, and then
    allowing the latter to boil between the introduction of each fresh
    supply, or by heating the food before adding it to the liquid.</p>

<h2>Evaporation</h2>

<p class="nonindent">Evaporation is another principle often overlooked in the cooking of
    food, and many a sauce or gravy is spoiled because the liquid, heated in
    a shallow pan, from which evaporation is rapid, loses so much in bulk
    that the amount of thickening requisite for the given quantity of fluid,
    and which, had less evaporation occurred, would have made it of the
    proper consistency, makes the sauce thick and unpalatable. Evaporation
    is much less, in slow boiling, than in more rapid cooking.</p>

<h2>Measuring</h2>

<p class="nonindent">One of the most important principles to be observed in
    the preparation of food for cooking, is accuracy in measuring. Many an
    excellent recipe proves a failure simply from lack of care in this
    respect. Measures are generally more convenient than weights, and are
    more commonly used. The common kitchen cup, which holds a half pint, is
    the one usually taken as the standard; if any other size is used, the
    ingredients for the entire recipe should be measured by the same. The
    following points should be observed in measuring:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The teaspoons and tablespoons to be used in measuring, are the silver
        spoons in general use.</li>
    <li>Any material like flour, sugar, salt, that has been packed, should
        either be sifted<a role="doc-noteref" href="#foot01" id="num01"><sup>1</sup></a> or stirred<a role="doc-noteref" href="#foot02" id="num02"><sup>2</sup></a> up lightly before measuring.</li>
    <li>A cupful of dry material is measured level with the top of the cup,
        without being packed down.</li>
    <li>A cupful of liquid is all the cup will contain without running over.
        Hold the cup in a saucer while measuring, to prevent spilling the liquid
        upon the floor or table.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Mixing Materials</h2>

<p class="nonindent">In the compounding of recipes, various modes are
    employed for mingling together the different ingredients, chief of which are 
    <i>stirring</i>, 
    <i>beating</i>, and 
    <i>kneading</i>.</p>

<p>By <i>stirring</i> is meant a continuous motion round and round with a spoon,
    without lifting it from the mixture, except to scrape occasionally from
    the sides of the dish any portion of the material that may cling to it.
    It is not necessary that the stirring should be all in one direction, as
    many cooks suppose. The object of the stirring is to thoroughly blend
    the ingredients, and this may be accomplished as well by stirring--in
    one direction as in another.</p>

<p><i>Beating</i> is for the purpose of incorporating as much air in the mixture
    as possible. It should be done by dipping the spoon in and out, cutting
    clear through and lifting from the bottom with each stroke. The process
    must be continuous, and must never be interspersed with any stirring if
    it is desired to retain the air within the mixture.</p>

<p><i>Kneading</i> is the mode by which materials already in the form of dough
    are more thoroughly blended together; it also serves to incorporate air.
    The process is more fully described in the chapter on "Bread,"</p>

<h2>Temperature</h2>

<p class="nonindent">Many a cook fails and knows not why, because she does
    not understand the influence of temperature upon materials and food.
    Flour and liquids for unfermented breads cannot be too cold, while for
    bread prepared with yeast, success is largely dependent upon a warm and
    equable temperature throughout the entire process.</p>

<h2>Cooking Utensils</h2>

<p class="nonindent">The earliest cookery was probably accomplished
    without the aid of any utensils, the food being roasted by burying it in
    hot ashes or cooked by the aid of heated stones; but modern cookery
    necessitates the use of a greater or less variety of cooking utensils to
    facilitate the preparation of food, most of which are so familiar to the
    reader as to need no description. (A list of those needed for use will
    be found on page 66.) Most of these utensils are manufactured from some
    kind of metal, as iron, tin, copper, brass, etc. All metals are
    dissolvable in certain substances, and some of those employed for making
    household utensils are capable of forming most poisonous compounds when
    used for cooking certain foods. This fact should lead to great care on
    the part of the housewife, both in purchasing and in using utensils for
    cooking purposes.</p>

<p>Iron utensils, although they are, when new, apt to discolor and impart
    a disagreeable flavor to food cooked in them, are not objectionable from
    a health standpoint, if kept clean and free from rust. Iron rust is the
    result of the combination of the iron with oxygen, for which it has so
    great an affinity that it will decompose water to get oxygen to unite
    with; hence it is that iron utensils rust so quickly when not carefully
    dried after using, or if left where they can collect moisture. This is
    the reason why a coating of tallow, which serves to exclude the air and
    moisture, will preserve ironware not in daily use from rusting.</p>

<p>"Porcelain ware" is iron lined with a hard, smooth enamel, and makes
    safe and very desirable cooking utensils. German porcelain ware is
    unexcelled for culinary purposes.</p>

<p>"Granite ware" is a material quite recently come into use, the
    composition of which is a secret, although pronounced by eminent
    chemists to be free from all injurious qualities. Utensils made from it
    are light in weight, easily kept clean, and for most cooking purposes,
    are far superior to those made from any other material.</p>

<p>What is termed "galvanized iron" is unsuitable for cooking utensils, it
    being simply sheet iron coated with zinc, an exceedingly unsafe metal to
    be used for cooking purposes.</p>

<p>Tin, which is simply thin sheet iron coated with tin by dipping several
    times into vats of the melted metal, is largely employed in the
    manufacture of cooking utensils. Tinware is acted upon by acids, and
    when used for holding or cooking any acid foods, like sour milk, sour
    fruits, tomatoes, etc., harmful substances are liable to be formed,
    varying in quantity and harmfulness with the nature of the acid
    contained in the food.</p>

<p>In these days of fraud and adulteration, nearly all the cheaper grades
    of tinware contain a greater or less amount of lead in their
    composition, which owing to its greater abundance and less price, is
    used as an adulterant of tin. Lead is also used in the solder with which
    the parts of tinware are united. The action of acids upon lead form very
    poisonous compounds, and all lead-adulterated utensils should be wholly
    discarded for cooking purposes.</p>

<p><i>Test for Lead-Adulterated Tin.</i>&#8212;
    Place upon the metal a small drop of
    nitric acid, spreading it to the size of a dime, dry with gentle heat,
    apply a drop of water, then add a small crystal of iodide of potash. If
    lead is present, a yellowish color will be seen very soon after the
    addition of the iodide. Lead glazing, which is frequently employed on
    crockery and ironware in the manufacture of cooking utensils, may also
    be detected in the same manner.</p>

<p>Cooking utensils made of copper are not to be recommended from the point
    of healthfulness, although many cooks esteem them because copper is a
    better conductor of heat than iron or tin. The acids of many fruits
    combine with copper to form extremely poisonous substances. Fatty
    substances, as well as salt and sugar, act upon copper to a greater or
    less degree, also vegetables containing sulfur in their composition and
    produce harmful compounds.</p>

<p>Utensils made of brass, which is a compound of copper and zinc, are not
    safe to use for cooking purposes.</p>
